## Fulfilment of the stated goals

<!-- naplnění cílů práce -->

As stated in our goals, we explored the ways of matching of public contracts to bidders when their interactions are described as linked open data.
Since the space of possibilities of applying matchmaking in this setting is vast, we managed to explore only a fraction of this space.
In order to maximize the information gathered in the exploration, we used sound heuristics to navigate the space of possibilities and select the more salient and informative features to explore.
