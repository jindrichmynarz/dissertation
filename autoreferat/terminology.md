# Terminology

<!-- použitá terminologie -->

We adopt the terminology established in knowledge engineering and related research areas.
Some of the key terms we use include the following.

Case-based reasoning
~ A methodology that learns from experiences of previously solved problems, which are called cases [@Richter2013, p. 17].

Data fusion
~ *"The process of integrating multiple data items representing the same real-world object into a single, consistent, and clean representation"* [@Bizer2009].

Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)
~ A data preparation workflow guided by the separation of concerns into the phases of extraction, transformation, and loading. 

<!-- Feature construction -->

Feature selection
~ A dimensionality-reduction technique that *"aims to choose a small subset of the relevant features from the original ones by removing irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features"* [@Wang2017, p. 503].

Linked data
~ A publication model for structured data on the Web based on explicit semantic links between the resources described in data.

Matchmaking
~ An information retrieval task that ranks pairs of demands and offers according to the degree to which the offer satisfies the demand.

Open data
~ A set of practices for publishing data that enables equal access to both all people and all machines.

Public procurement
~ The process by which public bodies purchase products or services from companies.

RESCAL
~ A machine learning algorithm for factorization of third-order tensors.

Resource Description Framework (RDF)
~ A graph data format for exchanging data on the Web.

Semantic web
~ Web of RDF data endowed with explicit semantics which machines can operate on.

SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL)
~ A query language for RDF data based on pattern-matching.

Statistical relational learning
~ *"Machine learning and data mining in relational domains where observations may be missing, partially observed, or noisy"* [@Raedt2017, p. 1177].

Tensor
~ A multidimensional array typically used to represent multi-relational data.

Tensor factorization
~ A method for decomposing tensors into lower-rank approximations.
