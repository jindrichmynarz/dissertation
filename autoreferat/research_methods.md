<!-- Research methods -->

We adopt the methods of the design science [@Hevner2004] in our research.
We design artefacts, including the Czech public procurement dataset and the matchmakers, and experiment with them to tell which of their variants perform better.
Viewed this way, our task is to explore what kinds of artefacts for matchmaking of public contracts to bidders are made feasible by linked open data.

<!-- Evaluation -->

The key question to evaluate is whether we can develop a matchmaker that can produce results deemed useful by domain experts representing the stakeholders.
We evaluate the developed matchmakers via offline experiments on retrospective data testing prediction of bidders awarded with contracts.
In terms of our target metrics, we aim to recommend matches exhibiting both high accuracy and diversity.
In order to discover the key factors that improve matchmaking we compare the evaluation results produced by the developed matchmakers in their different configurations.
