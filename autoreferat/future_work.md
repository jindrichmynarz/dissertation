## Future work

<!-- náměty pro další vědecké zkoumání -->

We explored only a handful of ways of matching public contracts to bidders.
Our work suggests that investing in improving the data quality may produce the highest returns.
Moreover, we expect methods better able to leverage unstructured data in literals, such as full-text search in semi-structured data, to have a considerable potential of improving the results of matchmaking.
Many more ways of relevance engineering for the task of matchmaking are left open to pursue and assess their worth.
However, evaluating matchmakers on the task of prediction of the awarded bidders may turn out to be a false compass.
Alternative ways of evaluation may bypass the weaknesses of this setup, possibly by conducting an online evaluation with real users or by involving domain experts in qualitative evaluation.
