## Applicability of the work

<!-- předpokládané další využití výsledků práce -->

The practical applicability of our work stems from the open source software we developed, including both matchmakers and data processing tools.
This software is open to reuse and adaptation.
However, while the data processing tools were designed to be reusable, the matchmakers are tied with our evaluation protocol, so they would need to be reworked for reuse.
If adapted, the matchmakers can be integrated with practical applications for managing public contracts, such as our prototype described in @Mynarz2014b, or [zInfo.cz](https://www.zinfo.cz), a platform for Czech public contracts maintained by Datlab s.r.o.
