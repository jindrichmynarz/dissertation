<!-- Goals -->

Our research goal is to explore matchmaking of public contracts to bidders operating on linked open data.
In particular, we want to examine what methods can be adopted for this task and discover the most salient factors influencing the quality of matchmaking, with a specific focus on what linked open data enables.
In order to pursue this goal we prepared public procurement linked open data and developed software for matchmaking.
Our secondary target implied by our research direction is to test the available implementations of the semantic web technologies for handling linked open data and, if these tools are found lacking, to develop auxiliary tools to support data preparation and matchmaking.
These secondary goals were not formulated upfront; we only specified them explicitly as we progressed in the pursuit of our primary goal.

<!-- Prerequisites -->

In order to be able to deliver on the stated goals, their prerequisites must be fulfilled.
Our research is built on open data and open-source software.
We need public procurement data to be available as open data. 
Data must be structured in a regular way from which a semantic, machine-readable description of the data can be created.
Regularity of the data arises from standardization, including the adherence to fixed schemas and code lists.
We conceive matchmaking as a high-level task based on many layers of technology.
Both our data preparation tools and matchmakers build on open-source components.
In the pursuit of our goals we reuse and orchestrate a large set of existing open-source software.
